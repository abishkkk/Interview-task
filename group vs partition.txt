1.To find the cumulative sum of quantity for each product, ordered by date:
SELECT order_id, product_id, order_date, quantity,
       SUM(quantity) OVER (PARTITION BY product_id ORDER BY order_date) AS cumulative_quantity
FROM orders;


2. To calculate the average price for each customer_id, considering only the top 3 most expensive orders:
WITH ranked_orders AS (
    SELECT customer_id, price,
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY price DESC) as rank
    FROM orders
)
SELECT customer_id, AVG(price) as avg_price
FROM ranked_orders
WHERE rank <= 3
GROUP BY customer_id;

3.To find the difference in quantity for each product between consecutive orders:
SELECT order_id, product_id, order_date, quantity,
       quantity - LAG(quantity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY product_id ORDER BY order_date) AS quantity_difference
FROM orders;
4.To determine the rank of each order for each customer based on the quantity, in descending order:
SELECT order_id, customer_id, quantity,
       RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY quantity DESC) AS quantity_rank
FROM orders;



5.To find the running total (cumulative sum) of the price for each customer, sorted by order_date:
SELECT order_id, customer_id, order_date, price,
       SUM(price) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY order_date) AS cumulative_price
FROM orders;
